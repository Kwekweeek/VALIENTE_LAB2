# Cylinder Area Program

## Description

This Java program calculates and displays the surface area and volume of a cylinder based on user input. The program demonstrates the concept of single inheritance by defining a base class (Cylinder) to compute the area and a derived class (CylinderVol) to compute the volume. Users provide the radius and height of the cylinder, and the program outputs the corresponding surface area and volume.

## Example

For an input of radius = 5 and height = 10, the output will be:

1. Area of the cylinder: 471.23889803846896
2. Volume of the cylinder: 785.3981633974483



## How to Run

1. Go to the src folder and find the Main.java file.
2. Copy the code provided and paste it into the Main.java file in your VS Code.
3. After compiling, run the program with: java Main
4. When prompted, enter the radius and height of the cylinder to see the calculated surface area and volume.

## Notes

This program is part of our laboratory activity in the subject *Data Structure and Algorithm Analysis*.
