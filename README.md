# Half-Diamond Star Number Pattern

## Description

This Java program prints a half-diamond star number pattern based on user input. The pattern features numbers increasing to a peak and then decreasing, forming a symmetrical diamond shape.

## Example

For an input of `5`, the output will be:

1. *1 *
2. *121 *
3. *12321 *
4. *1234321 *
5. *123454321 *
6. *1234321 *
7. *12321 *
8. *121 *
9. *1 *


## How to Run

1. Copy the code into `HalfDiamondPattern.java`.
2. Compile with `javac HalfDiamondPattern.java`.
3. Run with `java HalfDiamondPattern`.
4. Enter a number when prompted to see the pattern.
