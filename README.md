Cylinder Area Program
Description:
 This Java program computes and displays the surface area and volume of a cylinder based on user-provided inputs. It illustrates the concept of single inheritance by implementing a base class (Cylinder) to calculate the area and a derived class (CylinderVol) to determine the volume. Users input the cylinder's radius and height, and the program outputs the corresponding surface area and volume.
