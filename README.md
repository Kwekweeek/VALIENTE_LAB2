# Cylinder Area Program

## Description

This Java program calculates and displays the surface area and volume of a cylinder based on user input. The program demonstrates the concept of single inheritance by defining a base class (Cylinder) to compute the area and a derived class (CylinderVol) to compute the volume. Users provide the radius and height of the cylinder, and the program outputs the corresponding surface area and volume.

## Example

For an input of radius = 5 and height = 10, the output will be:

Area of the cylinder: 471.23889803846896
Volume of the cylinder: 785.3981633974483



## How to Run

1. Copy the code into `src folder/Main.java`.
2. Compile with `javac HalfDiamondPattern.java`.
3. Run with `java HalfDiamondPattern`.
4. Enter a number when prompted to see the pattern.

## Notes
